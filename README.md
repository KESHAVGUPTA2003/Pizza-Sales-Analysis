# Pizza-Sales-Analysis Using Power Bi
In my recent project, I developed a comprehensive Pizza Sales Dashboard using Power BI to analyze and visualize sales data. The objective was to gain insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and regional trends to help the business make data-driven decisions.

Key Features of the Dashboard:

Sales Overview:

Displays total sales, number of orders, and average order value over time.
Interactive charts and graphs provide a clear snapshot of monthly and yearly sales trends.
Product Performance:

Breaks down sales by pizza types, highlighting the best-selling and least popular items.
Visualizations include pie charts and bar graphs to show product performance and customer preferences.
Regional Analysis:

Maps and heat charts show sales distribution across different regions.
Identifies high-performing areas and regions with potential growth opportunities.
Customer Insights:

Segments customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior.
Utilizes scatter plots and demographic charts to understand customer preferences and buying patterns.
Time-Based Analysis:

Analyzes sales data by different time periods, such as weekdays, weekends, and holidays.
Helps identify peak sales hours and days, aiding in inventory and staffing planning.
Interactive Filters and Drill-Downs:

Users can filter data by date range, region, product type, and customer demographics.
Drill-down functionality allows for in-depth exploration of data points for detailed analysis.
This dashboard not only streamlines the sales data analysis process but also enhances decision-making efficiency by providing actionable insights through intuitive visualizations.
